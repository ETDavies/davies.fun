Napalm is an incendiary mixture of a gelling agent and liquid gasoline. It can cause severe burns, but even people not exposed to it could be killed through smoke exposure, hyperthermia, dehydration, and carbon monoxide. Particularly useful for the American military, however, were the psychological effects of its use. Agent Orange is a prominent herbicide and defoliant material. Children in Vietnam are [still being born with birth defects](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/3013636/vietnam-war-44-years-birth-defects-americas-agent-orange-are) due to exposure from the American bombing campaign almost fifty years ago. These birth defects could continue for the next twelve generations. The US government doesn’t classify it as a weapon.

As I write this I’m watching the Ohio Capital Journal’s live coverage of the Columbus protests and police response. There’s a lot more police out than there were last night. The Associated Press reports: [“Police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested.”](https://abc7.com/police-officer-who-knelt-on-george-floyd-has-been-arrested/6219184/) Not killed. Not murdered. Not lynched. Knelt. Tom Quinlan, our chief of police, ensures us that CDP “are listening to the concerns of our communities and are open to progressive policing strategies.”

Tear gas is a chemical weapon meant to cause eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness. Quinlan assures us that “the police encourage and embrace peaceful protest.” The Columbus Division of Police continues to spray it at protestors, so much of it that it hangs in the air and people nowhere near the spray zone have it in their eyes and lungs. They just fired off three more canisters. “It is sad to see what happened in our community. Our community deserved better,” Quinlan says. Of course he won’t tell us what it was that happenned in his view. Tear gas has been [internationally outlawed from military use](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-07-31/tear-gas-has-been-banned-warfare-why-do-police-still-use-it) since the 1990’s. I just watched the CDP fire another canister of it at unarmed civilians. Quinlan reminds us that “committing violent acts that violate Ohio law or hurt others is not helpful.”

What does Quinlan think happened last night? The Truth is that George Floyd died of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner found no evidence of strangulation or traumatic asphyxia. George Floyd was held down for eight minutes and forty-three seconds. For the last two minutes and fifty-three seconds he was [completely unresponsive with no pulse](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4ayvew/george-floyd-was-held-down-for-almost-3-minutes-after-he-went-unresponsive-and-had-no-pulse). The Truth is that this had no effect on his body or health. Floyd plead for his life the entire time. The Truth is that this had nothing to do with his death. The Truth is that MPD officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck as he struggled and yelled and cried and plead for eight minutes and forty-three seconds [“without intent to effect the death of any person.”](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.195)

Mark Fuhrman just appeared on Fox News to give his two cents on the protests. The police use bicycles as riot shields and as weapons. They use chemical warfare agents against unarmed protesters. You couldn’t do this in a war. Today Border Patrol flew a [Predator Drone](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dzbe3/customs-and-border-protection-predator-drone-minneapolis-george-floyd?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-motherboardvice&utm_content=later-7497640&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram&fbclid=IwAR20vcZdK_E3EiQy5G_EG3wAuMS-uWGZYp6gjWSKbM-WE62RjzN2rHmCS7M) over Minneapolis. A CNN reporter was [arrested live](https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4ed08403663fa4ed3518221d0f2a1552) on TV. Back in Columbus I just watched the police fire rubber bullets into the intersection of High St. and Gay St.

Since joining the Minneapolis police in 2001 Chauvin has been the subject of [ten complaints](http://complaints.cuapb.org/police_archive/officer/2377/), three oral reprimands, and no formal punishment. Minnesota Senator, former Presidential hopeful, and recent Vice Presidential favorite has called for “[a complete and thorough outside investigation](https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1265286358551191558)”. As the Hennepin County District Attorney she refused to prosecute more than a dozen officers accused of murdering civilians. One of them was named Derek Chauvin. The Truth is that the police do not shoot or kill civilians. The Truth is that these cases are “officer-involved shootings.” Fewer than 12% of MPD officers live within the city limits of Minneapolis. Carl Schmidt boiled all of politics down to a distinction between friend and enemy. If you’re a police officer, if you carry a service weapon, if you patrol a city you don’t live in, if you’re being given [surplus military equipment](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/ProgramFAQs.aspx), if you’re being trained by the [Israeli military](https://www.amnestyusa.org/with-whom-are-many-u-s-police-departments-training-with-a-chronic-human-rights-violator-israel/), if you’re told that you’re meant to be a
[killer first and a citizen second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETf7NJOMS6Y) , if you’re told that this is all a
[progressive strategy](https://twitter.com/ChiefQuinlan/status/1266484702317248513) meant to promote peace, what happens then? What then becomes your purpose? Who then becomes your enemy? Are you then willing to do what it takes to stop them? [How much will it hurt?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/16/usa.comment?CMP=share_btn_tw)
